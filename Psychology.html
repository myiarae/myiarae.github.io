<center><p>Ever since the first Psychology course I took during my sophomore year of high school, I have been fascinated with how the human mind works in all aspects. Abnormal psychology has just recently sparked my interest as well!</p><p>Abnormal psychology studies abnormal behaviors which interfere with an individuals daily functioning. I am particularly interested in the diagnostic processes and treatment plans that go along with disorders such as schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, or even generalized anxiety disorder. </p></center>

<center><p>I chose to attend the University of Maine in Orono, not only because it is only two hours from my hometown, or because of the in-state tuition, but because of the environment that came with the university.</p> <p>My older brother, Adam, attended the University of Maine, Orono, so growing up I would always see him over vacations or we would talk on the phone and would tell me all of these fun and exciting stories about living here. </p></center>
